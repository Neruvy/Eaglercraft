# Eaglercraft Browser

Eaglercraft javascript runtime. Multiplayer worlds available. Customizable profile, skins, settings, and controls. Game modes including creative, survival, peaceful, and more! Villages, mine shafts, dungeons, caves, ravines, many different biomes, and other things can spawn. The Nether and End are also available. Commands are the same as the real Minecraft. I'll try my best to update it often when a new update comes out.

If you need the offline HTML, [its the latest release on this repository.]  (https://github.com/ez1oo/Eaglercraft/releases/tag/eaglercraft)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you create a new world, it will be a black screen, or you may have spawned underground. <b>ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT 1–5 MINUTES!</b> It will fix on its own. It will also be laggy at first, but it will smooth out after 5–10 minutes. <b>Keep in mind that this is an old version of Minecraft and that not everything in the real current Minecraft will be avialable.</b>
